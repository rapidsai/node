# Run Steps

## OpenGL Window Setup
The visualization calls OpenGL window rendering from inside a docker container. Go to the demo root directory `rapids-js/`.

```bash
# run and access
npm run demo modules/demo/graph
```

## Run the Docker Container

You can setup and run the visualization with the docker commands below. Once the app is started, it will render the graph demo with openGL window. 


```bash
# setup directory
cd modules/demo/graph

# pull docker image
docker run --rm -it \
    --network=host -w "$PWD" -v "$PWD:$PWD" \
    rapidsai/rapidsai-nightly:cuda10.2-runtime-ubuntu18.04 \
    bash -l

# dask
pip install "git+https://github.com/dask/distributed.git" --upgrade --no-deps
pip install "git+https://github.com/dask/dask.git" --upgrade --no-deps

# run and access
python fa2.py
```

## FAQ and Known Issues
*What hardware do I need to run this locally?*
To run you need an NVIDIA GPU with at least 24GB of memory, and a Linux OS as defined in the [RAPIDS requirements](https://rapids.ai/start.html#req).


*How did you get source and destination nodes?*
Thereâ€™s no defined source and destination nodes in this dataset. the easiest way to do that is to run some sort of table -> graph transformation with a hypergraph.
The graph demo is an example of using cuDF/cuGraph in Python, and sharing the CUDA buffers with OpenGL in node.js via node-cuda bindings.
